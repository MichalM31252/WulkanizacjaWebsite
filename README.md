# 🌐 My First Freelancing Website Project  

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my **first freelancing project**, where I built a fully functional website from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and the lightweight CSS framework **[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)**. 🎉  

This project holds a special place in my journey as a developer—it marks the first time I was **paid for my work** as a freelancer. I am excited to share it with the world and demonstrate what I achieved!

## 💼 About the Project  

This website was built for **Wulkanizacja i Myjnia Samochodowa Felix**. I worked closely with the client to ensure the design matched their vision and delivered a polished, professional website they were proud of.  

It was a great opportunity to apply my skills, learn to manage a project independently, and provide value to a paying client.
